The flexible asynchronous ac link system abbreviated as FASAL system is a freely rotating rotating-transformer based power transmission or tie line system. It is a doubly fed freely rotating rotating- transformer which is realised by a free-running wound rotor induction machine. It is put in tie line which is in between two separate power systems. It controls the power transfer between these power systems which are asynchronous under some or all operating conditions. In this scheme the power flow is controlled by varying the frequency and / or voltage. Both power systems are here magnetically linked and electrically isolated. In case of a fault on either side of tie line or FASAL system, the effect of fault remains localized being electrically isolated due to magnetic coupling only. Thus it does not drain large power towards fault location or fault side from the healthy power system. Therefore, at the fault condition it gives sufficient cution period for switch-gear to act and isolate the faulty power system. Hence, it prevents the collapse of even a heavily loaded healthy power system or grid.  ",14

The circuit includes a master circuit consisting of a single clocked switch and a slave circuit consisting of another clocked switch. There is a feedback loop where two inversions occur in the forward path and a switch is connected in the backward path. Reducing the transistor count leads to lower parasitic capacitance in the circuit hence lesser dynamic power dissipation per clock period. The CLK-Q delay is optimized so that the circuit operates at high speed. Advantageously, the flip-flop is constructed using only ten transistors (including an invertor to produce complementary clock signals locally).

2081/MUM/2009 A ,10/09/2009,01/01/2010,A VARIABLE FRICTION DAMPER FOR CONTROLLING VIBRATIONS AND OSCILLATIONS OF HYDRAULIC GATES , 1)GODBOLE PRASHANT PRABHAKAR  ,"2/B, BUTY PLOTS, DHARAMPETH, NAGPUR 440 010, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA. ", 1)GODBOLE PRASHANT PRABHAKAR ,"This invention relates to a device for controlling flow induced vibrations & oscillations of different types of hydraulic gates like vertical lift gates, radial gates & tilting type gates used on spillways of dams, canals & barrages. The magnitude of disturbing forces caused by eddies or turbulent flow near the gate depends on extent of opening of gate. Thus, the magnitude of damping force or moment needed to control the vibrations also changes during gate operation. The friction dampers being employed presently provide a constant frictional damping force. The present invention overcomes this drawback by providing variable frictional damping force (in case of linear motion) or variable frictional damping moment (in case of angular motion), as the gate moves from one position to another as the gate travels from fully pen to closed position & vice versa. The device consists of 3 parts - i) a friction track of variable thickness which is fixed to gate, ii) a hinged joint arrangement attached to the gate supporting structure and iii) a friction shoe assembly, which is connected to hinged joint arrangement at one end, and impresses upon the friction track at other end. The friction shoe assembly consists of a self aligning type friction shoe held in a housing with a set of disc springs with a set pre-compression. An inward movement of shoe in the housing causes further compression of the disc springs, resulting in increase in reactive force exerted by springs on the shoe and vice - versa. During operation, when the gate starts to move from open to closed position or vice-versa, the friction shoe assembly swivels or rotates about the pin of hinged joint arrangement, and the self aligning friction shoe presses tightly against the friction track, developing initial frictional resistance. As the gate moves further, a gradually increasing thickness of friction track causes inward movement of shoe in the housing, resulting in development of greater contact force between shoe and track and hence greater frictional resistance. On the other hand, a gradually decreasing thickness of friction track during gate movement results in reduction in frictional resistance developed by the damper. Depending upon the pattern of variation in thickness of friction track, the damper thus develops progressively increasing or reducing frictional resistance or damping force, during movement of gate from one position to another during course of its operation. The novelty of the invention thus lies in typical arrangement comprising of a straight or curved friction track of variable thickness fitted to gate and a self aligning type friction shoe fitted to gate supporting structure and tightly adhering to the friction track, to provide variable frictional damping resistance of various patterns, as the gate moves from one position to another during its travel from fully open to closed position & vice versa. Second novelty of invention lies in use of hinged joint arrangement, which causes swiveling action of friction shoe assembly as soon as the gate starts its movement, and ensures development of initial fixed frictional resistance. Third novelty of the invention lies in use of disc springs and knee type joint between friction shoe & shoe support plate, which enables friction shoe to tightly press on to friction track and provide necessary frictional resistance, while continuously aligning its contact surface with surface of friction track by swiveling in the knee joint, when there is relative motion between the two.

This results in the generation and transmission of an MTU error message back to the initiating node. The edge router linked to the initiating node generates a MTU change message in response to receiving the MTU error message and multicasts the MTU change message to all local nodes to which it is linked.

The PSU injects small AC signals via surface electrodes in three orthogonal axes, each on a slightly different frequency (e.g., near 30 KHz). Indwelling electrodes electrically connected to the PSU resolves the magnitude of induced voltage for each of the three frequencies, thus measuring voltage for each of the three axes. Voltages are divided by induced current to yield impedance in each axis for each electrode. Impedance is proportional to position within the body. Such a system requires that a conductive material, such as a retractable helical tip-electrode, be exposed during implantation. Since the tip is retracted during implantation, this disclosure provides a modified distal portion employing at least one aperture (or ""window"") for fluid exposure of the helix-electrode and a deployable internal sleeve for covering the aperture(s) when the helix-electrode is extended.
